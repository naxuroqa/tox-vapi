/**
 * ''Tox'' is a peer to peer (serverless) instant messenger aimed at making
 * security and privacy easy to obtain for regular users. It uses
 * [[https://nacl.cr.yp.to/|NaCl]] for its encryption and authentication.
 *
 *  * ''C-Documentation:'' [[https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore]]
 *  * ''Binding-Maintainer(s):'' [[mailto:naxuroqa@gmail.com|naxuroqa <naxuroqa@gmail.com>]]
 *
 * == Public core API for Tox clients ==
 *
 * Every function that can fail takes a function-specific error code pointer
 * that can be used to diagnose problems with the Tox state or the function
 * arguments. The error code pointer can be NULL, which does not influence the
 * function's behaviour, but can be done if the reason for failure is irrelevant
 * to the client.
 *
 * The exception to this rule are simple allocation functions whose only failure
 * mode is allocation failure. They return NULL in that case, and do not set an
 * error code.
 *
 * Every error code type has an OK value to which functions will set their error
 * code value on success. Clients can keep their error code uninitialised before
 * passing it to a function. The library guarantees that after returning, the
 * value pointed to by the error code pointer has been initialised.
 *
 * Functions with pointer parameters often have a NULL error code, meaning they
 * could not perform any operation, because one of the required parameters was
 * NULL. Some functions operate correctly or are defined as effectless on NULL.
 *
 * Some functions additionally return a value outside their
 * return type domain, or a bool containing true on success and false on
 * failure.
 *
 * All functions that take a Tox instance pointer will cause undefined behaviour
 * when passed a NULL Tox pointer.
 *
 * All integer values are expected in host byte order.
 *
 * Functions with parameters with enum types cause unspecified behaviour if the
 * enumeration value is outside the valid range of the type. If possible, the
 * function will try to use a sane default, but there will be no error code,
 * and one possible action for the function to take is to have no effect.
 *
 * Integer constants and the memory layout of publicly exposed structs are not
 * part of the ABI.
 *
 * === Events and callbacks ===
 *
 * Events are handled by callbacks. One callback can be registered per event.
 * All events have a callback function type named `tox_{event}_cb` and a
 * function to register it named `tox_callback_{event}`. Passing a NULL
 * callback will result in no callback being registered for that event. Only
 * one callback per event can be registered, so if a client needs multiple
 * event listeners, it needs to implement the dispatch functionality itself.
 *
 * The last argument to a callback is the user data pointer. It is passed from
 * tox_iterate to each callback in sequence.
 *
 * The user data pointer is never stored or dereferenced by any library code, so
 * can be any pointer, including NULL. Callbacks must all operate on the same
 * object type. In the apidsl code (tox.in.h), this is denoted with `any`. The
 * `any` in tox_iterate must be the same `any` as in all callbacks. In C,
 * lacking parametric polymorphism, this is a pointer to void.
 *
 * Old style callbacks that are registered together with a user data pointer
 * receive that pointer as argument when they are called. They can each have
 * their own user data pointer of their own type.
 *
 *
 * === Threading implications ===
 *
 * It is possible to run multiple concurrent threads with a Tox instance for
 * each thread. It is also possible to run all Tox instances in the same thread.
 * A common way to run Tox (multiple or single instance) is to have one thread
 * running a simple tox_iterate loop, sleeping for tox_iteration_interval
 * milliseconds on each iteration.
 *
 * If you want to access a single Tox instance from multiple threads, access
 * to the instance must be synchronised. While multiple threads can concurrently
 * access multiple different Tox instances, no more than one API function can
 * operate on a single instance at any given time.
 *
 * Functions that write to variable length byte arrays will always have a size
 * function associated with them. The result of this size function is only valid
 * until another mutating function (one that takes a pointer to non-const Tox)
 * is called. Thus, clients must ensure that no other thread calls a mutating
 * function between the call to the size function and the call to the retrieval
 * function.
 *
 * E.g. to get the current nickname, one would write
 *
 * {{{
 *   size_t length = tox_self_get_name_size(tox);
 *   uint8_t *name = malloc(length);
 *   if (!name) abort();
 *   tox_self_get_name(tox, name);
 * }}}
 *
 * If any other thread calls tox_self_set_name while this thread is allocating
 * memory, the length may have become invalid, and the call to
 * tox_self_get_name may cause undefined behaviour.
